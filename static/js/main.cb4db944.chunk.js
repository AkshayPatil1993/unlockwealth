Don\u2019t be fraud to ask them what topics they want to Learn more about. 2.) Host online FB /IG/ Youtube live mini -presentation sessions to test your new contents effectiveness; use the feedback to update your content remember if you choose to do this publicly before you\u2019ve copy written your material you may risk expose to your content. We suggest that you use small beta groups to protect your creativity by having everyone sign non-complete, non-disclosures. 3.) Go back to the basics; before you go live ; go to the bathroom. In the public speaking classes in the early 90s we where taught to practice in our bathroom mirrors Yep, stand in front of your mirror in your bathroom and practice your talk. Check for grammar issues , pauses , redundant speach etc. You can also pull your family into the mix by hosting your full presentation in front of your family, be ready for the critiques, our families can sometimes be our hardest critiques! Tip: Writing your content in bullet proof form rather than full text will help your presentations flow.

When developing your business name consider choosing a name that has a multidimensional meaning; can the name translate between markets, industries and a diverse target market. It has to make sense; when developing your business name here are 5 tips you may want to consider: 1. Ensure that you understand your niche market first; your name should not only appeal you but to your market; remember you\u2019re not buying your services they are. 2. Take some time and choose words that you feel identify your brand; then search through their list of synonyms to see if any words stand out that can be used within the name. 3. Get creative by using a play on words, your name creatively (for personal brands) or symbols that have meaning and that you can easily explain. 4. Get a second and third opinion; from people that are connected to your brand or potential consumers. Enlist the help of your team or your tribe; once you identify a list of names, we suggest at least three to four. Ask your team or tribe which one appeals to them the most. 5. Once you find a name that truly fits your brand; conduct a state and national search to ensure that the name isn\u2019t already being utilized and seek council to legally register your name. It\u2019s important to take the time to understand your brands identity prior to creating your brands name. An ineffective name can cost you; if your market can\u2019t immediately identify with at least one term with the fabric of your brands name they just may skip right by you. Remember don\u2019t rush the process it takes time , we suggest a minimum of four weeks maximum of six weeks to develop and secure your name."})]}),Object(l.jsx)("br",{}),Object(l.jsxs)("p",{class:"read-more-blog",children:[" ",Object(l.jsx)("strong",{children:" Read more..."})]}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{class:"date-blog",children:Object(l.jsx)("i",{children:" Sep 16, 2021"})})]})})}),Object(l.jsx)("div",{class:"col-sm-4",children:Object(l.jsx)(o.b,{className:"blog-link",to:{pathname:"/blog3"},children:Object(l.jsxs)("div",{class:"blog-cont",children:[Object(l.jsx)("img",{class:"img-responsive",src:"img/blog3.jpg"}),Object(l.jsxs)("div",{class:"content-blog-para",children:[Object(l.jsx)("h3",{children:Object(l.jsx)("strong",{children:"Why Testimonials are important "})}),Object(l.jsx)("p",{children:"In the age of social media; buyers are not only researching your products, services or events benefits; simply because there are now so many buying options. The average buyer is also looking for looking for confirmation from people outside of the company; people who have benefited from the purchase, they\u2019re looking for Social Proof. Now more than ever with mobile video consumption percentages consistently on the rise. Consumers would rather watch a quick video then read texted data. With this understanding it\u2019s strongly suggested that brands begin to utilize testimonial videos as part of our marketing strategy.When one case study brand began to embarked on this journey; they simply asked their clients or event guest to, shoot a quick video to tell them about their experience. There was no strategy, just an ask, withno direct guidance some hit the nail on the headwhile the majority of the guests didn\u2019t. Even when gathering testimonials there should be a strategy, Gathering testimonials is much more than just the ask; although you have accomplished the first step by asking for testimonials, you also want to supply them with to complete a guided to help them curate their video testimonials; remember these videos not only showcase your business they showcase the person providing the testimonial as well. Feature those who showed heavy engagement, natural enthusiasm about the experience or service, those who shoot well on camera and those you know have had massive breakthroughs and AHA moments. For example let\u2019s take a local consulting firm\u2019s addition of testimonials from their signature event. Their events coordinator stated: In the case of one of our yearly signature events; we are currently preparing for our 4th annual installment of this event.Year one we only utilized pictures images in our advertisement for year two, although it was effective year two only yielded a 30 percent guest increase. For year two we targeted the guests we identified as our target market for testimonials and asked them to answer specific questions added to their personal takeaways and experience because we still wanted the testimonials to be real and authentic. We asked guided questions such as: 1. Why did they say yes to the experience? 2. What was their #1 take away or AHA moment. 3. What would they say to someone whose thinking about attending next year? Our results from tweaking our video testimonial strategy yielded exponential results. Our guests stated that adding the questions helped them during their interview. Year 3 our event sold out a week before the event. We\u2019re currently looking for a larger venue for our 4th annual experience. We found that properly utilizing video testimonial strategies can massively increase your desired results, the key is understanding the questions that potential guests may have and answering them
