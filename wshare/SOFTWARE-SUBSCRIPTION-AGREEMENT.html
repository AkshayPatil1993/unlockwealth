                        <li>5.1 Customer Ownership and License.  As between Customer and Wealth$hare, and subject to the rights of Wealth$hare set forth below, Customer owns all right, title and interest in and to all Customer Data and all Customer-provided marketing plans, designs, images, templates, sketches, artwork, logos, trade names, trademarks, and website or email text copy and type (“Customer Content”).  Customer has sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality and right to use of all Customer Data and Customer Content.  Customer grants to Wealth$hare and its suppliers a non-exclusive, fully paid-up license to use, reproduce, store, modify and publicly display Customer Data and Customer Content, to the extent necessary for Wealth$hare and its suppliers to perform their obligations under this Agreement.</li>
                        <li>5.2 Results. Customer acknowledges and agrees that Wealth$hare may (a) anonymize and aggregate benchmarking results of Customer use of the Wealth$hare Technology with results of other customers’ use (collectively “Results”); and (b) use and disclose the Results for any purpose provided that the Results do not individually identify Customer or Customer Data.</li>
                        <li>5.3 Wealth$hare Ownership.  As between Customer and Wealth$hare,  Wealth$hare and/or its licensors are the sole owners of all right, title and interest in and to the Wealth$hare Technology.  If Customer provides any feedback, comments, suggestions, ideas, requests, or recommendations for modifications or improvements to the Wealth$hare Technology (“Feedback”), Customer hereby assigns and agrees to assign all right, title and interest in any such Feedback to Wealth$hare to be used for any purpose.  All rights not expressly granted to Customer hereunder are reserved by Wealth$hare and its licensors.</li>
                        <li>5.4 Wealth$hare Technology License. Subject to payment in full to Wealth$hare as specified in an Order Form, Wealth$hare grants Customer a royalty free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, time-bounded license to use, for Customer’s internal business purposes only and subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Wealth$hare Technology as included in Subscriptions, maintenance and Services.     For use in connection with Subscriptions and Services, the term of Customer’s permitted use will be the duration of the Subscription.</li>
                        <li>5.5 Confidential Information.  “Confidential Information” means any information disclosed by one party (“Discloser”) to the other party (“Recipient”), either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection, which is designated as “Confidential,” “Proprietary” or some similar written designation or otherwise reasonably identifiable as confidential information.  Information communicated orally will be considered Confidential Information if the information is identified as being Confidential Information at the time of disclosure.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following is deemed Wealth$hare Confidential Information with or without marking or written confirmation: (a) the Wealth$hare Technology, product and service information, pricing information, and other related materials furnished by Wealth$hare; (b) the oral and visual information relating to the Wealth$hare Technology; (c) the Subscription’ environment and tools, materials, documentation, whitepapers, guides, data sheets, training materials, methodology and (d) the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This Agreement imposes no obligation upon a Recipient with respect to Confidential Information that:  (a) is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement by Recipient; (b) is already in the possession of Recipient at the time of disclosure as shown by Recipient’s files and records immediately before the time of disclosure; (c) is obtained by Recipient from a third party without obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by Recipient without use of or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information, as demonstrated by Recipient’s documents.  Recipient will only use Discloser’s Confidential Information to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement and will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information by using the same degree of care that Recipient uses to safeguard its own confidential or proprietary information of a like nature from unauthorized use, disclosure, or dissemination, but not less than a reasonable degree of care.  Recipient will restrict access to Discloser’s Confidential Information to Recipient’s employees and Consultants who require such access in the course of their assigned duties and responsibilities and who have been informed of Recipient’s obligations of confidence and have agreed in writing to preserve confidentiality of such information under terms and conditions no less restrictive than those set forth herein, provided that Customer must not permit a competitor of Wealth$hare to access Wealth$hare’s Confidential Information without Wealth$hare’s prior express written approval.  If Discloser’s Confidential Information is required to be disclosed under any law or judicial order, Recipient will (to the extent permitted by law) give Discloser prompt notice thereof and use its commercially reasonable efforts to seek or cooperate with Discloser in seeking a protective order at Discloser’s request and expense. Each party acknowledges that any unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information may cause the other party irreparable harm and that such party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief in the event the other party does not fulfill its obligations under this Section.</li>

If Customer's use of the Subscription is, or in Wealth$hare's opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of infringement specified above, Wealth$hare may, at its option and expense, obtain a license for the continued use of the Subscription or modify the Subscription to provide substantially equivalent functions and are no longer infringing, or, if neither of the foregoing alternatives are implemented, terminate Customer’s right to the allegedly infringing portion of the Subscription and refund to Customer any amounts prepaid for such Subscription for the period following such termination.

                        <li>9.1 Term.  Unless terminated earlier in accordance with this Section 9, the initial term of this Agreement is the period beginning on the Effective Date and ending the number of months or years specified in the Order Form thereafter (“Initial Term”).  At the end of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for consecutive renewal terms equal to twenty-four (24) months in length (each, a “Renewal Term”), unless either party gives the other party a written notice of termination at least sixty (60) days before expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term.  The terms Initial Term and Renewal Term will be collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “Term,” and each may be specific to an Order Form.

                        <li>10.5 Publicity. Wealth$hare may identify Customer as a customer of Wealth$hare.

Any dispute between the parties arising out of this Agreement will be first submitted to senior management of both parties for a good faith attempt at amicable resolution.  If the parties cannot settle the dispute within thirty (30) days after such meeting of senior management, the dispute will be mediated in confidential mediation proceedings by a mutually acceptable mediator to be chosen by Wealth$hare within thirty (30) days after written notice by either party demanding mediation.

                        <li>10.10 Force Majeure.  Except for Customer’s payment obligations, neither party will be liable to the other party for any delay or failure of Wealth$hare to perform its obligations hereunder if such delay or failure arises from any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of such other party.  Such causes include, but are not limited to, acts of God, floods, fires, loss of electricity or other utilities, or delays by Customer in providing required resources or support or performing any other requirements hereunder.</li>
                        <li>10.11 Independent Contractor.

Each party further agrees not to hire, solicit, nor attempt to solicit, the services of any former employee of the other party or former Subcontractor of Wealth$hare for a period of one (1) year from such former employee’s or Consultants last date of service with such other party.  Violation of this provision will entitle aggrieved party to liquidated damages against the other party equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the solicited person’s gross annual compensation.</li>
                        <li>10.13 Third Parties.  Wealth$hare will have the right to use Consultants in performance of its obligations and services hereunder and, for purposes of this Agreement, all references to Wealth$hare or its employees shall be deemed to include such Consultants.</li>

                        <li>10.14 No Waiver.  No failure or delay in enforcing any right or exercising any remedy will be deemed a waiver of any right or remedy.</li>
                        <li>10.15 Severability and Reformation. Each provision of this Agreement is a separately enforceable provision.  If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be or becomes unenforceable or illegal, such provision will be reformed to the minimum extent necessary in order for this Agreement to remain in effect in accordance with its terms as modified by such reformation.</li>
